## About the Challenge ðŸ¤¯

 There is a high demand for registering property areas for our clients. To solve this problem, we would like to create a platform with the following functionalities:

- Home screen with the rendering of the Map;
- Be able to draw the property area on the map [Polygon];
- After completing the drawing of an area, display a modal with a form  containing the following fields:
  - Property Name
  - Owner's Name
  - Address - [Street, Neighborhood, City, State, and Country];
- Use the "Google Geocoding API" to search for the address and automatically fill in the fields [Street, Neighborhood, City, State, and Country];
- Save Property data;
- When clicking on the Property area, display a modal with the details of the property.
- Option to delete and edit the area and property information.
- Data should be saved in local storage.
